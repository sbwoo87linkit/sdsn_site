<h2 class="heading"> SDSN Youth</h2>
<p>
    In 2012, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the <a href="http://unsdsn.org/" target="_blank">UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network</a> (SDSN) to mobilise global scientific and technological expertise to promote practical problem solving for sustainable development, including the design and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local, national and global scales. In 2015, the SDSN launched its official youth initiative (SDSN Youth) to empower youth globally to create sustainable development solutions.

<p>
    SDSN Youth educates young people about the challenges of sustainable development and creates opportunities for them to use their creativity and knowledge to pioneer innovative solutions for the SDGs. In addition, SDSN Youth creates platforms for young people to connect, collaborate and integrate their ideas and perspectives into national and regional pathways for implementation of the SDGs.
