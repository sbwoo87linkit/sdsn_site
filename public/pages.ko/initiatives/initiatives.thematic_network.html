<p>
    Following the adoption of the SDGs, the SDSN Thematic Groups are transitioning into Thematic Networks to support SDG advocacy and implementation in key areas. Each network has one or more institutional hosts, more flexible membership arrangements, and the ability to accommodate vastly larger groups of experts. Each Thematic Network is organized around one or more SDGs and serves four major purposes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        To act as a virtual knowledge hub through sharing new research, policy and programmatic developments, as well as educational materials (including through the SDG Academy);
    </li>
    <li>
        To support national and regional SDSNs and SDSN members on advocacy for the SDGs and operationalizing the goals in each country; Solution Initiatives, long-term pathways, and associated tools; and education on sustainable development, including through the SDG Academy.
    </li>
    <li>
        To identify and drive new forms of SDG monitoring, in conjunction with the Thematic Network on Data for Sustainable Development;
    </li>
    <li>
        To promote and undertake, on a case-by-case basis Solution Initiatives and special studies on how to achieve particular SDGs.
    </li>

        <a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/the-world-in-2050/" target="_blank">1: The World in 2050</a>
        <p>
            This network seeks to chart an integrated pathway for sustainable development through to 2050 that includes achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as interim milestones by 2030. Drawing on the best available modeling frameworks for the full range of SDGs, the network will also develop a business-as-usual pathway to identify the cost of inaction.

    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/humanitarian-development-linkages/" target="_blank">2: Humanitarian-Development Linkages</a>
    <p>
        This thematic network looks at how to accelerate progress in the most fragile regions and how to ensure coherence between the development and humanitarian agendas. The work of this network relates in particular to SDG 16 and cuts across all goals areas.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/gender-human-rights-and-social-inclusion/" target="_blank">3: Gender, Human Rights, and Social Inclusion</a>
        <p>
            This network focuses on human rights and works towards a world where the equal dignity and worth of every individual is respected and valued. It focuses in particular on the realization of SDGs 5, 10, and 16, and its work cuts across all goals areas.
        </p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/equal/" target="_blank">4: Education, Quality and Learning for All (EQUAL)</a>
        <p>
            This network takes a comprehensive, lifelong and multigenerational approach to learning to maximize the world’s potential for sustainable development. The network aims to support the fulfillment of SDG 4 in particular.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/health-for-all/" target="_blank">5: Health for All</a>
    <p>
        As articulated in SDG 3, health is crucial for sustainable development, as it sits at the nexus of the social, environmental, economic, and governance issues. While the MDGs brought new vigor to specific global health challenges, this network seeks to expand the global agenda, with a focus on Universal Health Coverage.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/low-carbon-energy-and-sustainable-industry/" target="_blank">6: Deep Decarbonization Pathways</a>
    <p>
        The network comprises the members of the Deep Decarbonization Pathway Project (DDPP), an initiative that prepares national, long-term low-emission development pathways that are consistent with the 2°C target, working with 16 country research teams. The work of the DDPP supports the achievement of SDG 13 on climate action.
    </p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/sustainable-agriculture-and-food-systems/" target="_blank">7: Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems</a>
        <p>
            This network explores how to provide healthy diets to a growing world population while reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. It also looks at how the three pillars of sustainable development can be realized in rural areas. The network’s activities explicitly aim to support the fulfillment of SDG 2.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/forests-oceans-biodiversity-and-ecosystem-services/" target="_blank">8: Forests, Oceans, Biodiversity, and Ecosystem Services</a>
        <p>
            This network seeks integrative solutions for securing biodiversity and improving the management of ecosystem services, from fisheries and timber to forest carbon sinks. Moving forward the work will be separated into a network focusing on oceans and one addressing forests in particular. Together they will support the achievement of SDGs 14 and 15.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/sustainable-cities-inclusive-resilient-and-connected/" target="_blank">9: Sustainable Cities: Inclusive, Resilient, and Connected</a>
        <p>
            Today, 50% of the world’s 7 billion people live in cities, and, by 2050, this will rise to 70%. This thematic network seeks to identify practical solutions for improving urban management and achieving sustainable cities and human settlements (SDG 11). The work will build on the Campaign for an Urban Sustainable Development Goal, which now aims to support SDG 11 and the achievement of all the SDGs at subnational levels.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/good-governance-of-extractive-and-land-resources/" target="_blank">10: Good Governance of Extractive and Land Resources</a>
    <p>
        Extractive industries are critical drivers of many economies, but often place a great burden on environmental systems, or affect societies in areas of extraction. This network looks at how to better use resource endowments, including land, for sustainable development. Much of the work of this group touches upon good resource management, linked to SDG 12, as well as accountability and building strong institutions, as per the objectives of SDG 16.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/redefining-the-role-of-business-for-sustainable-development/" target="_blank">11: Redefining the Role of Business for Sustainable Development</a>
        <p>
            The SDSN is partnering with the World Business Council and other business groups on a number of initiatives, including the Low-Carbon Technology Partnership initiative (LCTPi). This targeted collaboration replaces the dedicated Thematic Network.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4"><a href="http://unsdsn.org/what-we-do/thematic-networks/data-for-sustainable-development/" target="_blank">12: Data for Sustainable Development</a>
        <p>
            This thematic network seeks to identify new and innovative information and monitoring systems necessary to guide the SDGs, as well as existing approaches to data collection, compilation, analysis, and dissemination that might help data users to overcome gaps and limitations. The network members are actively engaged in Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data launched in September 2015.
