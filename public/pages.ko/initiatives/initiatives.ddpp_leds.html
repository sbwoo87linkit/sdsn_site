<h2 class="heading">Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project</h2>
<p>
    The <a href="http://www.deepdecarbonization.org/" target="_blank">Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP)</a> is an SDSN Solution Initiative co-founded with the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) to prepare national low-emission development pathways to 2050, consistent with limiting the rise in global temperatures to well below 2°C, as agreed in the Paris Agreement on climate change. The DDPP is conducted by 16 Country Research Teams composed of leading researchers and research institutions from countries representing more than 70% of global greenhouse emissions.

<p>
    The project will now focus on supporting the development of long-term low-emission development strategies, as agreed in the Paris Agreement. Energy research institutions from other countries are welcome to join the project. For more information please go to the
